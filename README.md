# Establish - The Installer

This program will help you install the latest operating system
images to your local device.

You can modify and create your own list from your server or use
the stock list.

I will try to keep that up-to-date.

The program will download, check and write in one action.

Once the write to the disk is complete the SHA256 checksum will
be displayed for your convenience.
