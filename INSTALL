You'll need to install EFL from enlightenment.org.

Most Linux distributions will use the package names of either:

efl-dev or efl-devel 

FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD contain recent versions of 
EFL and Enlightenment. Ordinarily named:

efl and enlightenment

You'll also need pkg-config and a C compiler!

Simply run "make" or "gmake" and run the "establish"
binary.

For generating OS image lists, you'll need golang 
installed too...
