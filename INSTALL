Best building from source.

You'll need to install EFL from enlightenment.org.

Most distributions will use the package names of either:

efl-dev or efl-devel 

You'll also need pkg-config and a C compiler!

Simply run "make" or "gmake" and run the "establish"
binary.

Protect disks that are important!
